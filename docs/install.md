# Installation

Installation from the official QGIS Python Plugins Repository is not yet supported. Please install from ZIP instead.

1. Navigate to the main page of the QClassiPy GitHub repository.
2. Above the file list, click on `Code` → `Download ZIP`. A zipped folder will download to your device.
3. Open QGIS and go to `Plugins` → `Manage and Install Plugins`.
4. In the left panel, choose `Install from ZIP`. Select the zipped folder and click `Install Plugin`.
5. You will receive a `Security Warning`, click `Yes`. Then a `Plugin Dependencies Manager` dialog will open, click `Ok`.
6. The plugin should install successfully. The plugin icon will appear in your plugin bar and a QClassiPy entry will appear in the Plugins menu.

7. Click on the icon. If the panel below opens, the plugin installation was successful. If you receive a `Missing packages` warning, on the other hand, it means there are
   issues with the Python external dependencies ([click here to solve](https://github.com/michelelissoni/QClassiPy/blob/main/docs/dependencies.md)).
