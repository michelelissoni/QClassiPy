6. Click on the icon. If the panel below opens, the plugin installation was successful. If you receive a `Missing packages` warning, on the other hand, it means there are
   issues with the Python external dependencies ([click here to solve](https://github.com/michelelissoni/QClassiPy/blob/main/docs/dependencies.md)).
